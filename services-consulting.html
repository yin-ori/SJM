        <h2>Research Consulting: Turn Your Thesis Into a Project</h2>
        <p class="text-quote">Guiding university students to achieve academic success through structured, project-based thesis planning.</p>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
          Writing a thesis is a complex, time-intensive challenge, especially for those studying in a foreign country.
          From adapting to different academic principles to balancing cultural nuances, international students face
          unique hurdles. I offer structured, project-oriented <strong class="half-background">workshops</strong> as well as <strong class="half-background">individual consulting</strong> designed to demystify the thesis process and
          provide students with the skills they need to plan, write, and complete their thesis with confidence.
        </p>

        <h3>Supporting Your Students’ Success</h3>
        <p>
          The workshops are specifically designed to meet the diverse needs of <strong  class="half-background">students in international settings</strong>. Conducted primarily in English, these courses are well-suited for international
          students, yet they can also be adapted for Japanese students or offered entirely in Japanese upon request.
          With a solid background in multicultural higher education, I bring insights into the varied academic
          expectations across cultures and tailor my approach to support students effectively, no matter their background.
        </p>

        <h3>Your Value</h3>
        <p>
          With extensive experience in academia and project management across Europe and Japan, I offer a unique skill
          set that combines academic expertise with structured project methodologies:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Academic Background:</strong> I have studied at higher education institutions, including the <strong">German University of Excellence, University of Bonn</strong>, during my undergraduate studies, <strong>Tôhoku University</strong> during my graduate studies, and passed doctoral classes at the <strong>Arctic University of Norway</strong> for my doctoral studies. This academic diversity equips me to address the specific needs of students from varied backgrounds.</li>
          <li><strong>Professional Experience:</strong> A decade of experience in IT project management in Germany and Japan have equipped me with proven methodologies for goal-oriented planning and effective execution. As a <strong>Certified Agile Product Owner</strong> and <strong>PMI Certified Associate in Project Management (CAPM)</strong>, I bring structured, agile techniques to help students manage complex projects like their thesis. In addition, I have completed research management certifications, bridging my project management skills with academic research practices. You can find my licenses here.</li>
          <li><strong>Student-Centered Approach:</strong> As both a working academic and a parent, I understand the time and responsibility pressures that academics face. I am committed to helping students break down their thesis projects into achievable, manageable steps, ensuring they can progress effectively toward completion.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Workshop Structure and Customization</h3>
        <p>
          My half-day workshops are offered <strong  class="half-background">online</strong> for flexible access or <strong  class="half-background">in person</strong>, if preferred. For on-site
          workshops, the commissioning institution is asked to provide the facilities. Each workshop generally
          accommodates up to 20 students. I am, however, open to customizing the format to meet the specific needs of
          your institution and student population.
        </p>
        <p>
          Following the workshop, I offer one-on-one follow-up sessions for students who seek additional guidance on
          individual challenges or detailed feedback.
        </p>

        <h3>Key Benefits for Your Students</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Structured Guidance:</strong> My workshops simplify the thesis process into manageable, actionable stages, providing students with clear strategies and practical tools.</li>
          <li><strong>Cross-Cultural Understanding:</strong> I bring valuable insights that address the distinct challenges international students may face when adapting to new academic environments.</li>
          <li><strong>Individualized Support:</strong> For students who need additional guidance, one-on-one sessions offer tailored advice to tackle personal hurdles and keep them on track.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Take the Next Step</h3>
        <p>
          Partnering with me can help your students gain confidence, stay organized, and approach their thesis with a
          structured, project-based mindset. <a href="contact.html"><strong>Contact me</strong></a> to learn more about
