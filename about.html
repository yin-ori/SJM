        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I am a researcher and writer with a deep-rooted passion for Japanese language and culture. My academic work is driven by a fascination with the ways in which <strong>language, culture, and emotion</strong> intersect, particularly within the context of Japanese linguistics.
        </p>
        <p>
          My research interests include <strong>Japanese grammar (<em>bunpō</em>)</strong>, <strong>Classical Japanese (<em>bungo</em>)</strong>, <strong>conceptual semantics</strong>, <strong>cognitive linguistics</strong>, <strong>philosophy of language</strong>, and the <strong>development of Japanese writing systems</strong>. In my doctoral thesis, I explore how <strong>emotion is encoded and shaped through Japanese language and cultural practices</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond academia, I’m drawn to literature, short fiction, poetry, anime, and manga. I find joy in discovering cultural references that are subtle, layered, and poetic, and I enjoy making them accessible to others. One especially moving experience was being entrusted with a personal <em>haiku</em> collection by a palliative care patient of my spouse. That encounter continues to shape how I understand both language and human connection.
        </p>
        <p>
          Living in Japan has offered me the rare opportunity to engage with these cultural and linguistic layers firsthand. Each day brings a new perspective, and I remain humbled by the depth and diversity of Japanese culture.
        </p>
        <p>
          I would <strong>love</strong> to hear your story too. Feel free to <a href="contact.html" class="external-links"><strong>reach out</strong></a> to me. I look forward to connecting.
